# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity & Design System
-   **Core Aesthetic:** Modern, sleek, and high-tech, utilizing a "Glassmorphism" design language to convey a cutting-edge AI feel.
-   **Color Palette:** Dark-mode centric with deep backgrounds (e.g., slate/gray/black) accented by vibrant gradients or neon highlights to make the artwork pop.
-   **Typography:** Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, system-ui) that ensure high readability for prompt text while maintaining a modern look.
-   **Components:**
    -   *Cards:* Semi-transparent glass-effect cards for prompt displays.
    -   *Buttons:* Prominent, high-contrast action buttons (especially for "Copy" and "Submit").
    -   *Animations:* Smooth transitions and subtle hover effects (using Framer Motion) to enhance interactivity without distracting from the content.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
-   **Frictionless Interaction:** The primary action (copying a prompt) must be instant and require zero unnecessary clicks.
-   **Visual-First Discovery:** The browsing experience should be led by the generated images themselves, with the text prompt revealed or easily accessible alongside.
-   **Clear Feedback:** Immediate visual feedback for actions (e.g., "Copied!" toast notifications, successful submission alerts).
-   **Mobile Responsiveness:** A fully responsive design that ensures the gallery and admin tools are usable on all device sizes.

## Brand Voice & Tone
-   **Professional & Inspiring:** The language should be encouraging and authoritative, positioning the platform as a tool for serious creators.
-   **Community-Centric:** Inclusive language that welcomes contributions from users of all skill levels.
-   **Concise:** UI text should be brief and action-oriented, avoiding clutter.

## Content & Moderation Guidelines
-   **Quality Control:** Only prompts that generate coherent, high-quality images should be approved.
-   **Safety:** Strict prohibition of NSFW, offensive, or harmful content.
-   **Attribution:** (If applicable) Respect for original creators by maintaining metadata or credits where possible.
